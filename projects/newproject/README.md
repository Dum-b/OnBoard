# PCB Hack Club Project

<!-- I am making a PCB hackcard to promote my friendship with Catie Foley, a student in my grade. She is the bestest and we designed our cards after each other. -->

<!-- $19.48 -->

<!-- Some challenges in my design process was that it took me some time to find a good program for outlining my images I want to display on the card. The actual component placement was easy and fun. -->
